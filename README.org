development has moved to [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~alanza/hither)

* hither

hither is a little Forth;
a stack-based language using “reverse Polish notation” for input.

requires Zig version 0.12.0 (and not later)
but has otherwise no dependencies.

at the moment very little is implemented.

with zig on your $PATH, you can do =zig build run= in the project root to play around with the interpreter.

for example

#+begin_src
type some hither code!
> 4 "x" name
ok
#+end_src

creates a variable named x with value 4.
“ok” is hither’s way of telling you that
your code ran without errors;
if you don’t get “ok” or an error message,
that means the interpreter thinks your code is incomplete.

you can now reference your variable

#+begin_src
> x
4
ok
#+end_src

and reassign it

#+begin_src
> x 3.0 / x =
ok
> x
1.33333333333333333
ok
#+end_src
